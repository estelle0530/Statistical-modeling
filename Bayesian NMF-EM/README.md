# Bayesian NMF-EM framework

##Background
Bayesian NMF models single cell count with exponential prior and infer genetic signatures in single cell RNA-seq transcriptomic data. However, background rate can confound true signal when conducting downstream analysis

##Method 
Derived and implemented exponential-gaussian mixture model to infer true expression activities


##Results
Increased power in detecting differentially expresed genetic signatures across conditions
