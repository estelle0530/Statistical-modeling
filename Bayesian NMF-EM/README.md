# Bayesian NMF-EM framework

## Background
[Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.6085.pdf) single cell count with exponential prior and infer genetic signatures in single cell RNA-seq transcriptomic data. However, background rate can confound true signal when conducting downstream analysis

## Method 
Derived and implemented exponential-gaussian mixture model to infer true expression activities

## Results
Increased power in detecting differentially expresed genetic signatures across conditions
