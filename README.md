# Statistical approaches to model and integrate high-dimensional genomic data 

## [Lasso regression approach to uncover cancer driver genesâ€™ network relationship with genomic instability and mutation](https://github.com/estelleyao0530/Statistical-modeling/tree/main/Lasso%20regression%20approach%20to%20uncover%20cancer%20driver%20gene%20network)
- Created combinatory features modeling interaction bewteen genomic features including expression, copy number alterations, and mutation status to predict proto-onco-gene expressions 
- Constructed multi-omic genetic network based on lasso regression model coefficients

## [Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization with expectation maximization algorithm to infer genetic signature](https://github.com/estelleyao0530/Statistical-modeling/tree/main/Bayesian%20NMF-EM)
- Derived exponential-normal mixture model to separate background distribution from true genetic activity thus increasing power to detect differentially expressed genetic signatures
